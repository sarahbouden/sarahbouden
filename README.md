ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sarra Bouden
I'm a final-year Data Science engineering student with a passion for building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. Currently, I'm expanding my horizons as an exchange student at Hochschule Schmalkalden University of Applied Sciences in Germany.

My journey in tech is driven by a curiosity for everything from foundational machine learning to the cutting edge of generative AI. I enjoy diving deep into the data, understanding the 'why' behind the numbers, and then building, training, and fine-tuning models to make accurate predictions and generate new insights.

What I Do ðŸ’»

Across my projects, I've had hands-on experience with:

ðŸ§  Deep Learning: Developing and fine-tuning neural networks for complex tasks, from classifying brain cancer scans with CNNs to enhancing audio data for speech emotion recognition using Diffusion Models.

ðŸ“ˆ Machine Learning: Applying a range of algorithms like XGBoost and Random Forest to tackle classic business challenges, such as predicting customer churn and forecasting industrial production with time series analysis.

ðŸ¤– NLP & Generative AI: Engineering semantic search features with LLMs (Mistral AI) and leveraging generative models to create synthetic data.

My Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Flask, Docker, and more.

My Goal ðŸš€
I am actively seeking a 6-month final-year internship where I can contribute to meaningful projects, particularly in the exciting field of Agentic AI systems. I'm eager to apply my skills to help build the next generation of AI-powered solutions.
